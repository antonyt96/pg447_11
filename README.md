Practice problem solution from Starting Out With C++ From Control Structures through Objects , 7th Edition. File name corresponds with page number and practice problem number.

A teacher has five students who have taken four tests. The teacher uses the following grading scale to assign a letter grade to a student, based on the average of his or her four test scores:

A=90-100
B=80-89
C=70-79
D= 60-69
F = 0-59

Write a class that uses a String array or an ArrayList object to hold the five students' names, an array of five characters to hold the five students letter grades, and five arrays of four doubles each to hold each student's set of test scores. The class should have methods that return a specific student's name, average test score, and a letter grade based on the average.

Demonstrate the calss in a program that allows the user to enter each students name and his or her four test scores. It should display each students average test score and letter grade.

Do not accept test scores less than zero or greater than 100.
